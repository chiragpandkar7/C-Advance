# Assignment 1: classes and strings
## overview ##
* In this assignment, we need to create a class which has a parameterised constructor and a member variable of type string.
* We need to pass the string member variable into a parameterised constructor and initialize it.

## Implementation ##
* In this project, we have a reader file, It has a member variable of type string which specifies filepath to read data from the location.
* It has a parameterised constructor which initializes the string member variable.
* I've done the exact implementation of assignment 1 in sketcher project in the form of reader file.
