# Assignment 2: Character Functions #
## Overview ##
* In this assignment, we need to create one function of type string.
* This function should take argument of type string and return a string value.

## Implementation ## 
* In the reader part of project, to validate the input file, I have created one validateFile() function which takes one string as an input and checks whether the line contains punctuation marks or not.
* If it contains symbols other that numbers and alphabets, it will return invalid
* Else it will return valid
* If the file data is invalid, we will not proceed furthur.
* This is the implementation of second assignment in this project.
