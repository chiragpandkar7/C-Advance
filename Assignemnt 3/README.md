## Overview ##
* This program reads data from a file named languages.txt and populates a vector of language objects based on the provided type definition. It then prints out the data in a specific format.

## Instructions ##
* Clone Repository: git clone <repository-url>

## Compile the Program: ##

g++ main.cpp -o language_processor

## Run the Program: ##
./language_processor
## Output: ##
The program reads the data from languages.txt, processes it, and prints the results.

## Example Output ##
C++, Stroustrup, 1979
Java, Gosling, 1991

* languages.txt: Input file containing language data. 
# Implementation Details #
* The program reads each line from languages.txt, extracts relevant information, creates a language object, and adds it to a vector. Finally, it prints the data in the specified format.
* In this project, I have created reader function which performs file input.
* The file writer function performs file input function.
# Dependencies #
* C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
